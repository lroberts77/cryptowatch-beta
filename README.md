## <a name="Project">Project Direction</a>
I created this app to merge my two interests of coding and crypto trading. This app allows you to quickly check the movements of your cryptocurrencies, price history charts and cryptocurrency news. I learned alot during the course of making this app including using ant-designs for responsive styling, API usage with redux, passing props from one component to another and Links with react-router.

## <a name="Install">Installation</a>
The deployed live app is [HERE](https://cryptowatch-beta.netlify.app/)

* Or to clone the repo
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:lroberts77/cryptowatch-beta.git
$ cd cryptowatch-beta
$ npm install
```

## <a name="Usage">Usage</a>
* In the root of the project
```shell
$ npm start
```
If a tab doesn't open with the cryptowatch-beta app running, open a new tab and type in localhost:3000 in the url bar and press enter. After the page has loaded scroll up and down to view cryptocurrency stats, top ten cryptocurrencies and latest cryptocurrency news. If you want to search for a cryptocurrency, click on the cryptocurrencies tab and type in the search box and it will filter the currencies to the value of the search box. Clicking on a cryptocurrency card will show you a price history chart for the cryptocurrency and also more detailed information about the currency. Clicking on the news tab will shows cards with all the latest cryptocurrency news and clicking on these wil take you to website with the full story.
